### Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 Hailing from the vibrant city of Hyderabad, India, I am Vaishnavi Varaganti, a dedicated tech enthusiast whose journey in Computer Science and Engineering has been nothing short of exhilarating. My fascination with the transformative power of technology began during my formative years, watching as it reshaped industries ranging from healthcare to finance.

🎓 Throughout my academic journey, I've consistently demonstrated a passion for learning and a knack for high performance. Graduating from secondary school with a perfect 10.0 CGPA and securing an outstanding 98.4 percentage in my senior secondary certificate, I set the stage for excellence in my undergraduate studies. Completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering with a commendable 9.36 CGPA, I deepened my knowledge and practical skills in this dynamic field.

🌐 While pursuing my degree, I actively engaged with the tech community. As a member of the IEEE team, I participated in code-a-thons and technical seminars, always eager to stay at the cutting edge of innovation. Additionally, I had the privilege of leading as the student council president, an experience that honed my leadership abilities and organizational skills.

🌟 Beyond academia, I am a passionate advocate for community engagement. Volunteering and contributing to various community initiatives allowed me to nurture my social and interpersonal skills, demonstrating my commitment to giving back.

🏆 My journey took a practical turn when I secured an internship at Epam Systems India Private Limited, a prominent tech company. This experience paved the way for my role as a Full Stack Developer, where I delved into technologies such as MongoDB, Express, React JS, and Node JS. These practical experiences not only enriched my skill set but also fueled my desire to reach greater heights in my career.

🌎 Now, as I prepare to embark on my master's program in the USA, I am drawn to this land of boundless opportunities and educational excellence. The United States, renowned for its prestigious academic institutions and cutting-edge infrastructure, provides the perfect backdrop for my continued pursuit of knowledge and innovation.

🚀 Join me on this exciting journey as I explore the ever-evolving landscape of Computer Science and Engineering, with a firm commitment to making a meaningful impact in the tech industry. Together, we'll uncover the endless possibilities that await in this dynamic field.
